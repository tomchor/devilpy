# Devilpy

Repurposed from lespy

Can be used with conda by adding local the path to this repo on `~/miniconda/envs/p37/lib`
and the conda environment can be recreated using `conda env create -f diablo_p37.yml` (although the preffix might need to be changed).

To include this in a conda environment for now, link this repo to:
/home/username/miniconda3/envs/p37/lib/python3.7/site-packages
